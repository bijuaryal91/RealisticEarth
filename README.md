# Realistic Earth

This project showcases a realistic 3D model of Earth using the Three.js library. The scene includes an animated Earth sphere, a cloud layer, and a starry background, providing an immersive visual experience.

## Features
- 3D Earth model with textures
- Rotating cloud layer
- Starry background
- Responsive design that fits any screen size

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bijuaryal91/RealisticEarth.git
   cd RealisticEarth

2. **Download the necessary textures:**
- Place the following images in the Images folder:
  - earthmap1k.jpg - Texture map for the Earth
  - earthbump.jpg - Bump map for surface detail
  - earthCloud.png - Texture map for clouds
  - galaxy.png - Texture map for stars

3. **Open index.html in your web browser:**

## File Structure
  ```bash
